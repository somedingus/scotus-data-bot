"""Transform · reselect: choose the best source-text field per opinion.

materialize retained every candidate transcription field per opinion; CourtListener
documents no precedence and its ``html_with_citations`` pick is not fidelity-safe
(often the OCR-dirty Harvard text). This stage records, per opinion, which field to
use downstream -- a pointer, not a copy, so it is non-destructive: every source field
stays in stg_opinions.

The choice is by priority, cleanest-and-opinion-only first (measured on the corpus):
- ``html_lawbox``: clean and opinion-only -- ideal when present (435/693, 0% dirty).
- ``xml_harvard``: opinion-only, but OCR-dirty for Dallas (long-s); preferred over html
  anyway, because correct scope beats cleanliness -- apparatus contamination is worse
  and harder to strip than localized, flaggable OCR noise.
- ``html`` (resource.org): clean words but BUNDLES the reporter apparatus (syllabus +
  arguments + other opinions) into the body -- wrong scope, so a last resort.
- ``html_with_citations``: CL's derived pick; a final universal fallback.

It works per opinion row, so it is neutral to the combined-vs-split representation: a
cluster's combined row and its per-justice split rows each get a source, and ``type``
is carried through so the distinction stays queryable (the "keep both, typed" decision
for the ~12 dual-representation clusters). Segmenting inline seriatim is a later stage.

Judging OCR damage is not this stage's concern: the priority order already encodes the
fidelity trade-off, and an opinion-level "dirty" flag influenced no choice here. The OCR
application owns detection and forms its own view of which text is degraded.
